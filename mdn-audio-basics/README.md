# Audio Context Test Project

This project is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application designed to test and demonstrate the use of the Web Audio API in a browser environment. The main goal of this project is to provide a simple interface for controlling audio playback, including panning and volume adjustment.

## Project Overview

The application allows users to:
- Play and pause an audio file
- Adjust the stereo panning of the audio
- Control the volume (gain) of the audio

This project serves as a practical example of implementing audio controls using the Web Audio API within a React and Next.js framework.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
